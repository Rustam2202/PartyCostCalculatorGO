        <h4>Why it's needed</h4>
        <a>
            If you are celebrating a common event (for example, a corporate party or New Year's Eve) with your friends
            or colleagues, then spending money on food, drinks, etc. is inevitable. Each of the participants may buy
            something specific and spend some amount or may not spend at all. After the event (especially with a
            hangover), it can be quite difficult to calculate who owes whom so that in the end everyone spends the same
            amount. This application should help to cope with this.
